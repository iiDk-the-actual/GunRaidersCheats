# Gun Raiders Cheats

### 📌 **What is this cheat?**  
These mods do varying things such as making the player hitboxes bigger, being able to fly, and killing everyone instantly at the flick of your knife!

### 🎮 **How does it work?**  
- These mods modify in-game objects contained inside of the `.obb` data.
- The `.obb` file contains all of the game's **textures, sounds, and objects**.
- When the `.obb` file is modified, the game's objects are modified too!

### ⚠️ **Warnings!** 
- Might get you banned if you use it in public lobbies.  
- Could mess with game balance, so don’t be that guy.  
- Use at your own risk! 

### 🛠 **How to install**  
1. Download the mod [from the releases page](https://github.com/iiDk-the-actual/GunRaidersCheats/releases/latest)
2. Remove the last bit of text from the end of the mod (example, remove `_FLY` from `main.509.com.gunraiders_FLY.obb`)
3. Open SideQuest and pair your headset
4. Navigate to `sdcard\Android\obb\com.gunraiders`
5. Delete the existing `.obb` file
6. Drag and drop the recently downloaded mod
7. Enjoy your cheats!

### ❓ **FAQ**  
**Q: Can I use this online?**  
A: Yeah, but don’t be surprised if you get reported.  

**Q: Will this break my game?**  
A: Probably not, but if it does, just reinstall Gun Raiders.  

**Q: Where is the source code?**
A: There is no source code, as this is a long process done manually rather than using any code. If you would like a tutorial into making these mods, you may watch this video: https://files.catbox.moe/60gsd5.mp4
